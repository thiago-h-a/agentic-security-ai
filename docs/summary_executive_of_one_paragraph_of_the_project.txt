SecOps-Graph is a modular, educational threat-hunting pipeline that
orchestrates a sequence of agents — collector, intel, hypothesis, query
builder, detector, correlator, and responder — to transform raw telemetry into
actionable incidents. The demo supports synthetic data runs and a websocket
telemetry stream, centralizes secrets in a `.env` file, and provides
lightweight Docker Compose files. The core is designed for clarity and
extensibility: components include CTI enrichment, query compilation, alert
scoring, incident correlation, and SOAR invocation, with an LLM-backed
augmentation layer that falls back to deterministic simulated responses when
no API key is present.
