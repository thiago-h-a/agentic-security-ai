Project expansion analysis and recommended next steps:

1) Unit tests: Create pytest suites for each agent verifying behavior with
   synthetic inputs (happy path, malformed inputs, and exception paths). Use
   fixtures to mock external tools (fetch_feed, run_query, perform_action) and
   LangChain responses. Target 80-90% coverage for core logic.

2) Circuit-breakers: Introduce resilience patterns for external calls
   (CTI feed, Elasticsearch, SOAR) with exponential backoff and open-circuit
   semantics when repeated failures are observed.

3) Hallucination checks: Add structured output constraints on LLM responses
   (JSON schemas) and validate outputs; compare LLM claims against trusted
   data (CTI, logs) and surface confidence scores.

4) Performance & Latency: Benchmark agents end-to-end using realistic event
   rates; instrument histograms and percentiles. Consider batching and
   parallelism for high-throughput ingestion.

5) Cost: For LLM usage, pick low-cost models for non-critical tasks
   (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo`) and reserve larger models for summarization only.
   Implement caching for repeated prompts to reduce token usage.

6) Metrics: Export counters and histograms to Prometheus or another TSDB.
   Add dashboards for per-agent latency, errors, and resource utilization.

7) Observability: Add structured logs, correlation ids, and tracing spans to
   propagate context across agents and external calls.

8) Security: Securely store secrets using a vault; avoid committing `.env` to
   source control. Harden HTTP clients and validate external responses.

This roadmap will help move the demo toward a production-ready prototype with
reliability, testability, and cost-awareness.
